# Air-Quality-Annual-Summary
1)Theoretical analysis of the dataset provided.

The Air Quality Annual Summary dataset from Kaggle provides hourly air quality data for various pollutants (including SO2, CO, O3, PM10, and PM2.5) for multiple cities in the United States. 
The dataset covers the years 2000 to 2016, and includes information on the maximum, average, and 98th percentile levels of each pollutant.

One possible theoretical analysis of this dataset would be to investigate trends in air quality over time.
This could involve examining whether levels of certain pollutants have decreased or increased over the years covered by the dataset, and whether any changes in pollution levels are correlated with changes in population, economic activity, or other factors.

Another potential analysis could be to investigate differences in air quality between cities.
This could involve comparing the average and maximum levels of each pollutant across different locations, and identifying any patterns or factors that may contribute to differences in pollution levels between cities.

Another interesting analysis would be to examine the correlation between air quality and health outcomes. 
This could involve looking at data on hospitalizations or mortality rates related to respiratory illnesses, and investigating whether there is a relationship between levels of air pollution and rates of these health outcomes.

In addition to these analyses, the dataset could also be used to explore other questions related to air quality, such as the effectiveness of air quality regulations or the impact of weather patterns on pollution levels. 
Overall, the Air Quality Annual Summary dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers interested in understanding and improving air quality in the United States.
